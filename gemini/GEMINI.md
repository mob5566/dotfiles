## Python Rules

- Please follow Google's Python coding style.
    - Maximum line length is 80 characters.
    - Indent your code blocks with 2 spaces.
    - Two blank lines between top-level definitions, be they function or class
      definitions. One blank line between method definitions and between the
      docstring of a class and the first method. No blank line following a def
      line. Use single blank lines as you judge appropriate within functions or
      methods.
- Please provide docstring as required.
- Use single-quote ' for string literals.
- Files should start with a docstring describing the contents and usage of the
  module. Here is the guideline and example:
    """A one-line summary of the module or program, terminated by a period.

    Leave one blank line.  The rest of this docstring should contain an
    overall description of the module or program.  Optionally, it may also
    contain a brief description of exported classes and functions and/or usage
    examples.

    Typical usage example:

      foo = ClassFoo()
      bar = foo.function_bar()
    """
